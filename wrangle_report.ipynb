    "- A tsv file called Image predictions\n",
    "- A twitter Api\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tThe csv file was read in and a dataframe was created from it\n",
    "-\tThe second file which is a tsv file was also read and a dataframe was created \n",
    "-\tA json file was created from twitter Api and the file was read in line by line and a dataframe was also created.\n",
    "## Assessing Data \n",
    "According to the instruction given, at least eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issue were to be detected and documented from the data gathered using both Visual assessment and Programmatic assessment to assess the data.\n",
    "After both Visual and Programmatic assessment were done on the dataframes created from the three sources of data, the following issues were noted:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality issues \n",
    "1.\treversed arrangement of rows in the twitter api dataframe\n",
    "2.\tMissing information - drop `in_reply_to_status_id` column on WeRateDogs twitter archive file.\n",

    "1.\tI converted the four columns namely - ('doggo', 'floofer', 'pupper', 'puppo') into two columns and gave them new names.\n",
